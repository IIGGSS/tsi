                Megan Denise Fox was born on May 16, 1986,[1][4] in Oak Ridge,
                Tennessee,[5][6] to parents Gloria Darlene (née Cisson) and
                Franklin Thomas Fox.[7] She spent her early childhood in nearby
                Rockwood.[8] Fox's father, a parole officer, and her mother
                divorced when Fox was three years old.[5] Her mother later
                remarried, and Fox and her sister[9] were raised by her mother
                and her stepfather, Tony Tonachio.[10][11][12] She was raised
                "very strictly Pentecostal", but later attended Catholic school
                for 12 years.[13][14] She said that the two were "very strict"
                and that she was not allowed to have a boyfriend[15] or invite
                friends to her house.[9] She lived with her mother until she
                made enough money to support herself.[15]

                In 2001, Fox made her acting debut in the romantic comedy
                Holiday in the Sun, as spoiled heiress Brianna Wallace and rival
                of Alex Stewart (Ashley Olsen), which was released direct-to-DVD
                on November 20, 2001. In the next several years, she
                guest-starred on the sitcoms What I Like About You and Two and a
                Half Men. Fox also appeared as an uncredited extra in the action
                film Bad Boys II (2003). In 2004, Fox made her feature film
                debut opposite Lindsay Lohan in the musical comedy Confessions
                of a Teenage Drama Queen, playing the supporting role of Carla
                Santini, a rival of Lola (Lohan). She was also cast in a regular
                role on the ABC sitcom Hope & Faith, in which she portrayed
                Sydney Shanowski, replacing Nicole Paggi. Fox appeared in second
                and third seasons, until the series was cancelled by ABC in May
                2006.[23] In 2007, Fox won the lead female role of Mikaela Banes
                in the 2007 live-action film Transformers, based on the toy and
                cartoon saga of the same name. Fox played the love interest of
                Shia LaBeouf's character Sam Witwicky. Fox was nominated for an
                MTV Movie Award in the category of "Breakthrough Performance",
                and was also nominated for three Teen Choice Awards.[23] She had
                signed on for two more Transformers sequels,[23][24] reprising
                her role as Mikaela in Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.
                There was controversy surrounding Fox's appearance while filming
                the sequel when Michael Bay, the film's director, ordered the
                actress to gain ten pounds.[25] The film was released worldwide
                on June 24, 2009, to box office success.[26]

                In 2009, Fox was targeted by a group of fashion-motivated
                criminals known as the "Bling Ring", who robbed her
                then-boyfriend Brian Austin Green's home for access to Fox's
                possessions.[93] Fox has a form of brachydactyly called clubbed
                thumb,[94] and has discussed her obsessive–compulsive disorder
                (OCD), insecurities, self-harming, and has acknowledged that she
                has low self-esteem.[95] In 2013, she said that her Christian
                faith is still very important to her and she believes it keeps
                her grounded.[96] Fox and then-husband Green were supporters of
                Generosity Water, and funded the creation of over ten water
                wells for the organization.[97][98] With regard to relationships
                and her sexuality, Fox said that she has a general distrust and
                dislike of men,[99] and that the perception of her as a "wild
                and crazy sexpot" is false because she is asocial and has only
                been sexually intimate with her "childhood sweetheart" and Brian
                Austin Green; she stated that she would rather stay at home
                instead of going out,[100][101] and emphasized that she cannot
                have sex with someone she does not love.[92][100] She is
                bisexual, and said she believes that "all humans are born with
                the ability to be attracted to both sexes".[102] She stated in
                2009, "I have no question in my mind about being bisexual. But
                I'm also a hypocrite: I would never date a girl who was
                bisexual, because that means they also sleep with men, and men
                are so dirty that I'd never want to sleep with a girl who had
                slept with a man."[103] Fox told InStyle in July 2021: "A girl
                would come up to me and be like: 'You had a lot to do with me,
                like identifying and understanding that I was gay or
                understanding that I was bisexual...' And that, of course, is by
                far, like, the most moving, rewarding thing that I have
                experienced in my life! To be a part of something that helped
                people figure that out, or helped people deal with that, or feel
                better about that. One of my favorite things that I get called,
                is being like, a bi icon and that is one of the things I am the
                most proud of!"[104]
